## Pelvic Obliquity

A curved or contoured seating surface, such as a wheelchair canvass, may not necessarily provide an appropriate level of support.

The pelvis is relatively unstable and unable to correct obliquity. The trunk will move to accommodate the pelvic  position in order to maintain head and shoulder functional alignment. The posture will adapt to the seating surface and could lead to postural deformity.

## Flat Seat Surface

A horizontal surface is a good starting point.

## Pelvic Control

A horizontal surface without pelvic control or alignment will still allow postural deformity to develop.
