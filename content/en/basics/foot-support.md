## Foot Support

![Sitting on flat support surface with feet supported](/en/images/03.jpg)

Support for the feet has been added and adjusted in height to allow 90 degrees at ankles and knees, and to support the femur horizontally. Long seat depth still allows posterior pelvic tilt.

Support for the feet is again added to move the thighs to horizontal. Now ankles, knees and pelvis are supported at 90 degrees, and pelvis is upright. However. the flat backrest still causes the trunk to fall forwards over base.

Seat depth, knees and feet are all supported correctly. The pelvis needs support to maintain an upright position and the backrest needs shape to provide a contoured support in the upright balanced position.

This is the type of position we are seeking, but we need to add back support and other elements to help support the pelvis in an upright position.
