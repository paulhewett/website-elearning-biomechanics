## Backrest

![Sitting upright with backrest added](/en/images/07.jpg)

The backrest has now been added, but note that to accommodate the lumbar curve (or a gap caused by a particular posture or trunk/pelvis size), there is a space between the backrest and the PSIS aswell as underneath the femur.

The backrest can be shaped to fill this gap. This part of the backrest acts on the sacrum and need to be firm to help keep the pelvis upright. The sacral pad works with other elements on the seat which we will look at shortly.

Our backs are not flat, and a flat backrest will only provide a small contact area which can increase pressure.

A curved cushion will allows load to be more evenly distributed and is anatomically more appropriate.
