## Welcome to this elearning module

We've designed this eLearning module to be very easy to use. We do hope you enjoy it, we'll be going over some keypoints at the end.

The navigation on the left will guide you through the chapters. A tick will indicate that you have read that page. Each chapter is divided into sections, you can see each of these on the navigation bar. You can also navigate using the previous and next arrows on the page. Where a particular topic has number of parts, you can naviaget through these using the table of contents at the top of the page.

On some pages, we highlight key points with a Note, a Tip, or a Warning like this:

{{% notice tip %}}
Take notice of Notes, Tips and Warnings . We'll use them to highlight keypoints, and things that are important for you to remember.
{{% /notice %}}

Our eLearning modules work on mobile too, so you can catch up with the latest content whenever you get chance.

If you have any questions, please do get in touch. We'd love to hear from you. Make good use of social media too to discuss with you peers and colleagues what you have learnt here.

That's the introduction complete, [so let's move on](/en/basics/)!
