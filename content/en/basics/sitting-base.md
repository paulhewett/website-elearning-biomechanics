## Curved support surface

The posture will adapt to the shape of the seating surface. While the seating system may appear to offer comfort, as the seat shape may be accommodating an unsuitable position, it could may reduce function and comfort over the long term. 

## Flat support surface

Flat of orthogonal support surfaces can be a positive move but they are still accommodating a posteriorly tilted pelvis. Note that the feet are still unsupported. Hips and knees are not positioned to 90 degrees. Here the pelvis and lower back are unsupported.

## Corrected seat length

A shortened seat depth supports the pelvis in an upright position, but the flat backrest causes the trunk to move forwards over base. It will be difficult to obtain an upright posture. Feet again are unsupported, and so thighs are not horizontal.
