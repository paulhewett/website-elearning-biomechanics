## Anterior Knee Support

![With anterior knee support](/en/images/29.jpg)

An anterior support to the femoral condyle of the left knee works in conjunction with posterior and lateral pelvic supports on the right hip.

Similarly, an anterior support on its own will not correct pelvic asymmetry or hip alignment but will tend to push the pelvis away from the posterior support.

Finally we apply a support to the right knee to promote abduction at the right hip. It is not always necessary to provide anterior support on the right knee.

## Complete support

These four key points of support should facilitate the  correct postural alignment. This is providing the seat depth and other dimensions are maintained for growth. It is also important the foot position is adjusted to reflect the hip and knee alignment taking account of any remaining asymmetry.
