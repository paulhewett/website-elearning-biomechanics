## Laterals Supports

![Thigh supports](/en/images/21.jpg)

Pelvic lateral support alone is not sufficient, especially if poorly designed or not adjusted.

## Asymmetrical Position

![Asymmetrical pelvis](/en/images/20.jpg)

The pelvis will often 'pull' to one side resulting in postural deformity, sometimes exacerbated by thoracic lateral supports.

![Laterals with correct width adjustment](/en/images/22a.jpg)

Pelvic laterals that have been correctly adjusted for with should not normally allow for lateral movement of the pelvis.

## Backrest Shape

Unlike a flat backrest, aswell as better at ditributing load, a curved backrest will provide some lateral support.

## Thoracic Laterals

![Correctly adjusted laterals](/en/images/22.jpg)

Adding thoracic laterals in conjunction with a curved backrest will also help with good alignment and symmetry by allowing the trunk to stack and balance above a stable base.

## Check vertical alignment

Once the trunk has been aligned above the pelvis, it's important to go back and check the alignment of hips, knees and feet.
