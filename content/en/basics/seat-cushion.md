## Seat Cushion

![](/en/images/07.jpg)

We have correctly adjusted the footrests and seat depth but there is a space between the backrest and the PSIS aswell as underneath the femur.

A ramped cushion fills this space to support the thighs in a horizontal position giving them a loadbearing throughout their length. The seat cushion is flat under the ITs to allow the pelvis to pivot actively.

The trunk is supported in a balanced position above the pelvis. The centre of gravity acts vertically through body segments which arebalanced above the pelvis. The pelvis still needs support to maintain an upright position.

The pelvis is now fully supported in an upright position now the sacral support has been added.
