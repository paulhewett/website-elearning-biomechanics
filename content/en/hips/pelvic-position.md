## Pelvic Position

![Unsupported pelvis](/en/images/24.jpg)

Without support, the pelvis may adopt an asymmetrical, windswept position. This may be because the right adductors have limited range and may lead to a risk of migration of the right hip. In this situation, the left hip is relatively safe because it has a greater range of movement into abduction.

To provide the best support for pelvis and hips, start by aligning the pelvis against the posterior support. The left hip is now abducted. More importantly, the right hip is still very adducted.
