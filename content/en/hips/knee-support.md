## Pommel

![Unsupported pelvis](/en/images/26.jpg)

Use of a sacral support with a just a pommel will only tend to allow the pelvis to drift to one side.

Introducing a pelvic lateral support will provide a third point of support and start to correct postural asymmetry of the pelvis.

The right hip is now supported in a slightly abducted position.

However, as anterior support is not provided, the pelvis will naturally accomodate to the shortness of the right adductors and will move forwards on the left with increased abduction. 

The right hip still remains at risk.
