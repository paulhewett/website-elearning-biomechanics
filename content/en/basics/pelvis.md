## Supporting the pelvis

![Cushion in place](/en/images/10.jpg)

Now the ramped cushion and sacral pad are in place, we can introduce the additional elements that are required to maintain the pelvis in an upright position.

A pelvic strap is added to help hold the pelvis against the sacral support.

However, it may still possible for the pelvis to tilt and slip forward under the pelvic strap in an unsupported position of posterior tilt.

Here an anterior knee support has been added to provide anterior support through the femoral condyles to the pelvis to maintain it in an upright position. In order to do this correctly, the seat must be adjusted correctly to provide the correct seat depth for the pelvis to be supported in the upright position.

With a correctly adjusted system, load is distributed throughout the supporting surface both on the seat base and the backrest.

![Opposing forces](/en/images/14.jpg)

The anterior force provided by the kneeblock is equal and opposite to the posterior force provided by the sacral support. This provides a rotational moment to keep the pelvis in an upright position.

A moment is calculated by multiplying the force by the perpendicular distance from its line of action. 

The two forces are equal and opposite and have parallel lines of action. The system is in equilibrium as the resultant force is zero, during quiet sitting. We can define this in mechanical terms as a ‘couple’.

In reality, during normal sitting, posture is dynamic. The system will rarely be in a state of equilibrium as external forces (such as an extension spasm) will act and cause acceleration. Remember Newton’s Laws of Motion: a body remains at rest or continues in a straight line at a constant velocity unless acted upon by an external force.
