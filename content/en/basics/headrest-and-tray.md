## Headrest and Tray

![tray and headrest added](/en/images/16.jpg)

The headrest provides a limit to head movement and maintains correct alignment with the trunk.

Anterior support can be provided by an anterior chest support on the tray, or a chest harness.

Both of these elements will allow the trunk to learn to move between forward lean and upright.
